# Showdown-Bot

This is a Pokemon Showdown bot that I programmed in about 3 hours.  It was supposed to have a ban command, but I honestly don't even understand what the requirement for that command is and my attention span is so short that I've already started two other projects and don't have time to finish this one.  I'm just gonna put some last touches on parts of it and then commit it without testing it.  It definitely worked before I added all that args stuff in the Main function and I honestly thing that it's pretty good for only like 3 hours of work.  If for some reason the main function definitely does not work just remove all that stuff and recompile it, it'll probably work.

It's also Monday 9/10 right now BTW

This is totally unfinished.  I just don't feel like finishing it.

I also don't know how to release java things
